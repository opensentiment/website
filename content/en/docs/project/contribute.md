We are excited to welcome you to the OpenSentiment community! Being in the early phase of development, we need passionate contributors like you to help the project reach its full potential. There are several ways you can make an impact, and every contribution is valuable. 

## Dataset Research

As the backbone of our tool, the datasets we use need to be comprehensive and accurate. We're looking for contributors to assist in researching diverse sources of news articles across the political spectrum and from different geographic regions. Your role would involve identifying potential sources, assessing their quality, and providing recommendations.

## Dataset Creation

The creation of robust and representative datasets is a challenging but crucial task. Contributors in this area will collaborate to curate and annotate a corpus of news articles. Note the inherent difficulty: we strive to tag articles with their respective political biases, a task fraught with subjectivity. To address this, we are exploring the idea of creating categories based on the model output embeddings, instead of traditional tags like "left-wing" or "right-wing". This allows us to group and compare news outlets based on their similarity in opinions. It's a challenging but rewarding area where innovative thinking is welcomed!

## Core Tool Development

The heart of the project is the OpenSentiment tool, powered by AI models like Falcon and GPT NeoX. We're in need of contributors with a background in machine learning to assist with model fine-tuning, testing, and improvement. Your work here will directly shape the capabilities of OpenSentiment.

## Model Training/Finetuning

Model training and fine-tuning is an iterative and complex process, and we need machine learning enthusiasts to join us. Your tasks would involve training the models on our datasets, fine-tuning to improve accuracy, and testing the models for validity. This is an opportunity to work on cutting-edge AI models and significantly influence the project's success.

## Documentation & Website Maintainment

We believe in making OpenSentiment accessible and user-friendly. For this, we need web developers and UX/UI designers to enhance the website's usability, functionality, and aesthetics. If you're someone who can make complex things look simple, we need you!

## Partnerships and Donations

Aside from contributing your skills, you can also support us through partnerships and donations. By forming partnerships, we can leverage collective capabilities to make OpenSentiment even better. Donations, meanwhile, help us sustain the project, expand its reach, and accelerate its development.

OpenSentiment is an ambitious project and we can't do it without your help. Join us in making unbiased news analysis a reality for everyone!
